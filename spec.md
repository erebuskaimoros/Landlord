Let's a Property Management App for landlords who mostly own single family units. Like a CRM, for landlords.

The primary Object of this app will be a Unit (residence). Units will consist of

Some ideas:
-Tenant Info
-Legal Info
-Marketing Info (for when the user need to get new tenants)
-Financial Info (money in/out)
-Maintenance Info
--Which contractors do you use for which services for this Unit
-Unit Assets
--Info about appliances, unique features
-Photos

We'll want want a Unit Onboarding Process, where new Unit Files are created.

We'll also want a Unit Management Process, where the user can create Tasks/Work orders for a given Unit. Task creation can be automated for routine maintenance.

Tasks will be connected to Units, so you'll be able to see the Unit's Task History.

We'll also want to maintain a list of Contractors who work for the User/Landlord
