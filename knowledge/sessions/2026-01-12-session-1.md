# Session 1 - Product Specification Interview

> Date: 2026-01-12
> Focus: Comprehensive product specification through detailed stakeholder interview

## Summary

Conducted an in-depth product interview covering all aspects of the Landlord property management SaaS. Captured 30+ detailed decisions across data model, financials, user management, integrations, and technical architecture. Produced a comprehensive 600+ line specification document ready for implementation planning.

## Work Done

- Interviewed stakeholder with 28 multi-choice questions across 7 rounds
- Documented decisions on: tenant history (full timeline), financials (full AR/AP), multi-unit buildings, task automation, contractor management, roles, integrations, and more
- Determined business model: per-unit SaaS pricing
- Recommended tech stack: Next.js + React Native (Expo) + Supabase + PostgreSQL
- Created detailed specification document with data model, workflows, and development phases

## Discoveries

- **Linked tenancy model preferred** - One tenant record with multiple lease periods, not separate records per lease (affects data model design)
- **Full AR/AP needed** - Simple ledger not sufficient; need expected vs actual tracking, aging reports, payment plans
- **Building container for multi-unit** - Need to support landlords who own subset of units in larger buildings with fixed-percentage cost splitting
- **Progressive disclosure for onboarding** - Start minimal, prompt for more detail over time rather than wizard or dump-all-fields approach
- **Tenant portal designed for but not built** - V1 is landlord-only but architecture should accommodate future tenant features
- **One-way accounting sync** - QuickBooks/Xero export only, avoid two-way sync complexity
