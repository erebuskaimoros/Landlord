# Session 2 - Phase 1 Implementation Planning

> Date: 2026-01-12
> Focus: Creating detailed implementation plan for Phase 1 (Core Foundation)

## Summary

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for Phase 1 of the Landlord property management SaaS. The plan uses a vertical slice approach with full test coverage at each slice, building thin end-to-end functionality then iterating to add depth. Covers database schema, project structure, 8 implementation slices, testing strategy, and verification checklist.

## Work Done

- Analyzed spec-detailed.md to understand Phase 1 scope (auth, units, buildings, tenants, leases, transactions)
- Launched Plan agent to design complete implementation strategy
- Designed database schema with 15 tables, RLS policies, and audit triggers
- Defined Next.js project structure with App Router
- Created 8 vertical slices for incremental delivery
- Established testing strategy (Vitest + Playwright)
- Saved plan to knowledge folder for persistence

## Discoveries

- **Organization-based multi-tenancy with RLS** - Simpler than schema-per-tenant, adequate for property management scale
- **Linked tenancy model** - One tenant record with multiple lease periods (vs creating new tenant per lease)
- **Application-layer financial filtering** - Manager role restrictions handled at app level (more flexible than pure RLS)
- **JSONB audit logs** - Provides schema flexibility over time with immutability constraints

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| knowledge/phase1-implementation-plan.md | Created - Full Phase 1 implementation plan |

## In Progress

None - planning session complete. Ready for implementation.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- [ ] Set up Supabase project (local + remote)
- [ ] Create database migrations for all tables
- [ ] Implement basic RLS policies
- [ ] Build auth flow (login/signup/logout)
- [ ] Start Slice 1: Skeleton + Auth
