# Session 4 - Assets on Unit Detail Page

> Date: 2026-01-15
> Focus: Display and quick-add assets/appliances on unit detail page

## Summary

Added assets display to the unit detail page with a visual grid of standard appliances. Users can now see at a glance which appliances a unit has (refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, etc.) and quickly add missing ones with pre-filled forms. This improves the unit management experience by surfacing equipment info directly on the unit page.

## Work Done

- Added assets query to unit detail page.tsx (fetches assets for the unit)
- Updated UnitDetailClient props to accept assets array
- Created STANDARD_APPLIANCES constant with 8 common appliances (refrigerator, stove, dishwasher, microwave, washer, dryer, hvac, water_heater)
- Built visual 4-column grid showing each appliance with emoji icons
- Existing assets display as clickable cards with condition badge and make
- Missing assets show as dashed "Add" buttons that open pre-filled AssetForm
- Added "Other Equipment" section for non-standard assets
- Extended AssetForm with defaultAssetType and defaultName props for quick-add functionality

## Discoveries

- Assets were implemented in Phase 2 but never integrated into the unit detail page
- AssetForm defaultValues only apply on mount, so conditional rendering is needed when reusing with different defaults
- Pre-existing build errors exist (server component imports in lease-documents.ts) unrelated to this work

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| app/src/app/(dashboard)/units/[id]/page.tsx | Added assets query to parallel fetch |
| app/src/app/(dashboard)/units/[id]/unit-detail-client.tsx | Added assets grid UI with quick-add functionality |
| app/src/components/forms/asset-form.tsx | Added defaultAssetType and defaultName props |

## In Progress

None - session complete

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test quick-add asset flow end-to-end in browser
- [ ] Consider adding asset count badge to units table
- [ ] Fix pre-existing build errors in lease-documents.ts (server component import)
- [ ] Add ability to edit/delete assets directly from unit page
