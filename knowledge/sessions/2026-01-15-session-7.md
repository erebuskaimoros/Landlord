# Session 7 - Test Seed Data

> Date: 2026-01-15
> Focus: Create comprehensive test data for development and demo purposes

## Summary

Created a complete test seed data migration with realistic property management data including 5 units, 5 tenants, 46 assets, contractors, tasks, and transactions. Set up a test user account and linked it to the test organization so all seed data is immediately accessible in the app.

## Work Done

- Created `supabase/migrations/00016_test_seed_data.sql` with comprehensive seed data
- Added 1 organization (Acme Property Management), 2 buildings, 5 units
- Created 5 tenants (4 active, 1 former) with contact and emergency info
- Added 5 leases (4 active, 1 expired) with realistic terms
- Created 3 contractors (plumbing, electrical, landscaping) with service types
- Added 6 tasks in various statuses (open, in progress, completed, cancelled)
- Created 46 assets covering all core appliance types (stove, HVAC, dishwasher, refrigerator, washer, dryer, etc.)
- Added 9 transactions (rent payments, expenses)
- Created 6 photos with geolocation metadata
- Set up test user account (test@example.com / testpassword123)
- Linked test user to Acme Property Management organization as owner

## Discoveries

- Deleting organizations with cascade requires disabling audit triggers due to circular FK reference with audit_logs table
- Audit trigger names follow two patterns: `audit_tablename` (Phase 1) and `tablename_audit_trigger` (Phase 2)
- Supabase Auth manages auth.users directly; users must sign up through the app, then can be linked to orgs via SQL
- After db reset, browser sessions remain cached but user no longer exists - need to re-signup

## In Progress

None - session complete

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add more transaction history for financial reporting testing
- [ ] Create additional task photos for before/after documentation testing
- [ ] Add recurring task instances for scheduling feature testing
- [ ] Consider adding a second test organization for multi-tenant testing
- [ ] Add maintenance logs for assets to test service history features
